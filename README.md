#The website created by Starz in space

#Introduction
At the year of 2045, human beings have developed more advanced technologies to make a outer space travel, we are such a company that provides the space travel for our customers.
Overview
we have developed several tourism activities on the Pluto. Thanks to a tight connection with NASA which they will provide us the most advanced spaceship. This spaceship is designed at the 1/10th speed of light, which will shorten the time arriving the outer space. We will offer several adventures on Pluto, we have safe plan to keep them safe with water and food , and we have designed some entertainments for them when they arrive on Pluto, everything we do is just focused on the principle of "Best service for our customers". When they land on Pluto until they reach the Earth again ,they will have an unforgettable experience.
Challenge:
1.Lacking of data and knowledge of details of pluto, less of whole and real picture we can find, So we use photo shop to deal with some photos and using keyshot and rhino to build model, like the spaceship.
2.One of member got his knees hurt, and we have to cooperate remotely.
3.Till far, Mankind still have few knowledges about the deep space and the geographical situations far from the Sun. so we can not get enough informations about the planet.
4. We have no konwledge how to construct 3d model in the Aero-enginering area .

#Some of adventures :
Have fun with the photo-taking with ice volcano
Witness the true love with the one you love
skydiving with the low gravity experience
In our ice park
Frozen beauty treatment technology

#Future Expectation
As there is limited to the imaginary ability of us, so there are somethings that we have not thought, but we strongly hold the view that in the next few years, we will have more information about the outer space and people will more be likely to accept the space traveling.
